### Technology Stack

#### Backend

- Persisting data using Firebase as a BaaS, with ReactFire mixin

#### Frontend

- React, React Router
- Webpack with hot reloading
- ES6 with Babel
- SCSS
- ESLint

### TODO
- Implement Firebase as a BaaS (partially implemented -- currently saving completed game boards)
- Tests -- unit tests with mocha/chai, functional tests with mocha/casperjs
- Stats -- show how many times X / O have won historically
- MSH colors/styles
- UX Design
- Separate development/prod webpack configs
- and of course... refactor code
